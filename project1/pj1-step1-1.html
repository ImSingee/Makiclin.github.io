    <p>Six years was a long time to be in jail, but it’s an entire era online. Writing on the internet itself had not changed, but reading — or, at least, getting things read — had altered dramatically. I’d been told how essential social networks had become while I’d been gone, and so I knew one thing: If I wanted to lure people to see my writing, I had to use social media now.</p>

    <p class="disco">So I tried to post a link to one of my stories on Facebook. Turns out Facebook didn’t care much. It ended up looking like a boring classified ad. <br>No description. <br>No image. <br>Nothing. <br>It got three likes. <br>Three! <br>That was it.</p>

    <p id="himax">It became clear to me, right there, that things had changed. I was not equipped to play on this new turf — all my investment and effort had burned up. I was devastated.</p>

    <p>Blogs were gold and bloggers were rock stars back in 2008 when I was arrested. At that point, and despite the fact the state was blocking access to my blog from inside Iran, I had an audience of around 2&nbsp;0&nbsp;,&nbsp;0&nbsp;0&nbsp;0&nbsp; people every day. Everybody I linked to would face a sudden and serious jump in traffic: <br>I could empower or embarrass anyone I wanted.</p>


    <p>People used to carefully read my posts and leave lots of relevant comments, and even many of those who strongly disagreed with me still came to read. Other blogs linked to mine to discuss what I was saying. I felt like a king.</p>

    <p>The iPhone was a little over a year old by then, but smartphones were still mostly used to make phone calls and send short messages, handle emails, and surf the web. There were no real apps, certainly not how we think of them today. There was no Instagram, no SnapChat, no Viber, no WhatsApp.</p>

    <p class="disco makeshorter">Instead, there was the web, and on the web, there were blogs: <br>the best place to find alternative thoughts, <br>news and analysis. <br>They were my life.</p>
