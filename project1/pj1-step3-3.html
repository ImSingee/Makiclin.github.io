    <p class=g1>Six years was a long time to be in jail, <br>but it’s an entire era online. <br>Writing on the internet itself had not changed, but reading — or, at least, getting things read — had altered dramatically. <br>I’d been told how essential social networks had become while I’d been gone, <br>and so I knew one thing: If I wanted to lure people to see my writing, <br>I had to use social media now.</p>

    <p class=g2>So I tried to post a link to one of my stories on Facebook.<br> Turns out Facebook didn’t care much. It ended up looking like a boring classified ad.No description.No image.Nothing.</p>
    <p class=se> It got three likes.<br> Three! <br>That was it.</p>

    <p class=g3>It became clear to me, <br>right there, <br>that things had changed. <br>I was not equipped to play on this new turf — all my investment and effort had burned up. <br>I was devastated.</p>



    <p class=g4>Blogs were gold and bloggers were rock stars back in 2008 when I was arrested. <br>At that point, and despite the fact the state was blocking access to my blog from inside Iran, <br>I had an audience of around 20,000 people every day. <br>Everybody I linked to would face a sudden and serious jump in traffic: <br>I could empower or embarrass anyone I wanted.</p>


    <p class=g5>People used to carefully read my posts and leave lots of relevant comments,<br> and even many of those who strongly disagreed with me still came to read. <br>Other blogs linked to mine to discuss what I was saying. <br>I felt like a king.</p>

    <p class=g6>The iPhone was a little over a year old by then,<br> but smartphones were still mostly used to make phone calls and send short messages, handle emails, and surf the web.<br> There were no real apps, certainly not how we think of them today.<br> There was no Instagram, no SnapChat, no Viber, no WhatsApp.</p>

    <p class=g7>Instead, <br>there was the web, and on the web, there were blogs: <br>the best place to find alternative thoughts, news and analysis. </p>

    <p class="se">They were my life.</p>
